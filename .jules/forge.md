**Learning:** `bootstrap_stdlib` was over 3600 lines long, a classic God Function anti-pattern that cluttered the `lib.rs` file. Moving it to its own file dramatically improved readability.
**Action:** Always look for massive setup or registration functions and extract them to dedicated modules, using `pub(crate)` to share internal helpers.
