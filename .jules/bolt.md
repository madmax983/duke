**[JImage Index Map Preallocation]
**Learning:** [HashMap::new() for large, known-size collections causes severe reallocation overhead during startup, especially when parsing files with 30,000+ entries like the JDK jimage file.]
**Action:** [Always use `HashMap::with_capacity(capacity)` when the final size of the collection is already known from headers (e.g., `resource_count`).]
