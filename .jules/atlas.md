**Standardize Workspace Error Types**
**Tangle:** Each module defined its own duplicate aliases like `VmResult`, `LoadResult`, and `ParseError`, breaking standardized `Result<T, crate::Error>` rules.
**Blueprint:** Removed domain-specific error aliases in favor of standard `Result` and `Error` types across all crates.
**[Encapsulate Module Facades]
**Tangle:** The `pub mod` declarations for internal sub-modules like `reachability` and `ser_helpers` were publicly exposed, violating encapsulation boundaries.
**Blueprint:** Changed the visibilities to `pub(crate) mod` to encapsulate the modules, while re-exporting only the specific items like `find_shortest_path` where needed.
**[Encapsulate `duke_classfile` Facade]**
**Tangle:** The `duke_classfile` API exported an intermediate `types` module (`pub mod types`) merely to re-export its inner types, and `duke-telemetry` exposed internal serialization helpers via `pub mod ser_helpers`. This creates confusing, leaky abstractions and redundant paths.
**Blueprint:** Encapsulated both modules. In `duke_classfile`, replaced `pub mod types` with direct `pub use` statements at the crate root, eliminating the `types` namespace from the public API entirely. In `duke_telemetry`, reduced `ser_helpers` visibility to `pub(crate)`.

**[Fix `jar_diff` and Encapsulate `ser_helpers` Facade]
**Tangle:** The `duke_classfile` API had its `types` namespace previously removed but left broken type paths in `jar_diff.rs`. In `duke_telemetry`, the internal serialization helpers were still exposed via `pub mod ser_helpers`.
**Blueprint:** Fixed `jar_diff.rs` to use correct module paths and closure parameter types. Reduced `ser_helpers` visibility to `pub(crate)` in `duke_telemetry`.
