**Standardize Workspace Error Types**
**Tangle:** Each module defined its own duplicate aliases like `VmResult`, `LoadResult`, and `ParseError`, breaking standardized `Result<T, crate::Error>` rules.
**Blueprint:** Removed domain-specific error aliases in favor of standard `Result` and `Error` types across all crates.
**[Encapsulate Module Facades]
**Tangle:** The `pub mod` declarations for internal sub-modules like `reachability` and `ser_helpers` were publicly exposed, violating encapsulation boundaries.
**Blueprint:** Changed the visibilities to `pub(crate) mod` to encapsulate the modules, while re-exporting only the specific items like `find_shortest_path` where needed.
**[Encapsulate `duke_classfile` Facade]**
**Tangle:** The `duke_classfile` API exported an intermediate `types` module (`pub mod types`) merely to re-export its inner types, and `duke-telemetry` exposed internal serialization helpers via `pub mod ser_helpers`. This creates confusing, leaky abstractions and redundant paths.
**Blueprint:** Encapsulated both modules. In `duke_classfile`, replaced `pub mod types` with direct `pub use` statements at the crate root, eliminating the `types` namespace from the public API entirely. In `duke_telemetry`, reduced `ser_helpers` visibility to `pub(crate)`.
**[Fix Encapsulation of telemetry helpers module]**
**Tangle:** The `duke-telemetry` crate exported its internal `helpers` module and `ser_helpers` submodule more visibly than necessary, causing potential encapsulation leaks.
**Blueprint:** Reduced visibility of `mod helpers` to private and made its contents `pub` inside. Reduced visibility of `duke_classfile` types export to correctly re-export rather than exposing internal `types` namespace, then updated call sites in `jar_diff.rs` to respect the public API.
