**Tangle:** [The Structural Mess]
**Blueprint:** [The Structural Fix]

**Refactoring the Duke Interpreter Blob**
**Tangle:** The `crates/duke-interpreter/src/lib.rs` file had grown into a massive "Blob" anti-pattern (over 23,000 lines). It mixed JVM data structures, the registry, execution engine logic, and an enormous amount of standard library bootstrapping/tests, making it hard to navigate and violating the single responsibility principle.
**Blueprint:** Extracted the core execution context data structures (`MethodEntry`, `FieldEntry`, `ExceptionEntry`, `ClassContext`) into a new `context` module, and the registry types (`ClassRegistry`, `NativeRegistry`, handler definitions) into a new `registry` module. These are now re-exported from `lib.rs` to maintain a clean public API while breaking up the physical file bloat.

**Unified Error Handling Types**
**Tangle:** Each crate (`duke-bytecode`, `duke-classfile`, `duke-loader`, `duke-runtime`) had its own named error type (`DecodeError`, `VerifyError`, `ParseError`, `LoadError`, `VmError`) and result type. This led to an inconsistent API surface and "Trait Pollution" across the workspace when handling cross-crate failures.
**Blueprint:** Standardized error types across modules by renaming crate-specific errors to `crate::Error` and `crate::Result<T>` using `thiserror`. Combined `DecodeError` and `VerifyError` into a centralized `duke_bytecode::Error` enum. Aliased the old names to maintain backward compatibility and avoid breaking the public API ("The Facade").
**[Split ClassFile types]
**Tangle:** `duke-classfile/src/types.rs` was a Blob anti-pattern holding constant pool, attributes, and class structures.
**Blueprint:** Split into `constant_pool.rs`, `attributes.rs`, and `class.rs` to match domain responsibilities.

**Refactoring the Duke Interpreter Blob (Test Extraction)**
**Tangle:** The `crates/duke-interpreter/src/lib.rs` file was an enormous "Blob" anti-pattern containing over 38,000 lines, with more than 20,000 of those lines being inline tests. This violated the single responsibility principle and made navigating the core execution engine and native handlers extremely difficult.
**Blueprint:** Extracted the 20,400+ lines of inline tests from `lib.rs` into a separate `crates/duke-interpreter/src/tests.rs` module and linked it via `#[cfg(test)] mod tests;`, drastically reducing the physical sprawl of the main interpreter file.
